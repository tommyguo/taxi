        <p class="text">
          More than a third of rides on 1/1/2016 took place during the late night.
          As New Year's Eve celebrations came to a close, people headed home and taxi pickups peaked
          between 12 a.m. and 3 a.m.
          <br><br>
          The block group bordered in red had by far the highest concentration of rides during the late night.
          Located in the Lower East Side, there were over 1000 rides within such a small area. Why?
          Probably because of the New Year's Eve party at Hotel on Rivington.

          Morning had a lot fewer pickups, three times less than the number of pickups during the late night.
          New Yorkers were probably sleeping in after celebrating New Year's.
          <br><br>
          The two most active areas in the morning correspond to more touristy places: near Penn Station and Times Square.
          Perhaps some tourists did not participate in New York's New Year's Eve parties and were awake enough to
          either come into the city through Penn Station or sightsee in Times Square.

          Taxi pickups increased again in the afternoon. It's interesting to note that there were 20% fewer rides
          during the afternoon than there were during the late night, but there were 6 times as many block groups that
          exceeded a concentration of more than 10,000 rides per square km during the late night.
          <br><br>
          This suggests that rides were more concentrated during the late night and more spread out during the afternoon.
          Perhaps there were a few New Year's Eve parties during the late night that drew large crowds, which were gone
          by the afternoon.

          As the evening kicks in, taxi pickups once again become more concentrated. Pickups increase in the area bounded by
          Midtown and Soho/Lower East Side.
