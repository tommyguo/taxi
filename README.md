## For Beginners: Making Your Own Visualization

To make your own visualization, click the green "Clone or download" button on the page and select
"Download ZIP".  

Then you will need to install Node.js. Learn how to do this for Mac [here](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)
and for Windows [here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows).  

Now with Node.js installed, go ahead and unarchive the zip you just downloaded, which should then give you a folder called "taxi-master".  

Open up Terminal if you're on Mac or Command Prompt if you're on Windows and navigate to the taxi-master folder. A tutorial on those
commands can be found for Mac [here](http://www.dummies.com/computers/macs/mac-operating-systems/how-to-use-basic-unix-commands-to-work-in-terminal-on-your-mac/)
and for Windows [here](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands).  

In Terminal/Command Prompt, type in
```bash
npm install
```
This installs dependencies that the code uses.  

Finally, in Terminal/Command Prompt, launch the server that hosts the code by typing
```bash
node app.js
```

Now, open up your browser and in the navigation bar, type in
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

This should bring you to the same visualization found at [https://evening-falls-91841.herokuapp.com/](https://evening-falls-91841.herokuapp.com/).
